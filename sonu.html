        <h3>Statement 1. Course Selection and Teacher Assignment System
            Description: Design and Develop and develop a comprehensive Course
            Selection and Teacher Assignment System for a university. In this system,
            each student must choose 4 theory courses and 2 lab courses per semester,
            selecting a teacher for each course from an available pool. The system should
            feature a user-friendly interface and a robust database to manage course
            selections, teacher assignments, and student preferences. Students will be able
            to view detailed teacher profiles, including ratings from the last four years,
            research projects, patents, and academic background. The platform should
            also allow students to submit feedback on their experience with each teacher.
            The goal is to create a seamless and data-driven platform that optimizes
            course-teacher matching, enhancing the academic experience by providing
            students with the necessary tools to make informed decisions based on
            teacher performance and expertise.
